# Foreword

Welcome!! This handbook is designed to give each family a look at some of the most important parts and information about the Native Sons and Daughters Programs&trade;. Much of the information in this book is also contained in the larger [Native Sons and Daughters Programs&trade; manual](http://www.nationallonghouse.org/program-manual) and other resource materials. By giving this information to each family, it shares some of the basic information, and will hopefully spawn creativity with individual members, and in the tribal groups, which are the heart of the program. Share this book together with your child.

You have chosen the Native Sons and Daughters Programs&trade; as a way to grow the bond between parent and child. The time given now will reap rewards later on. Someone once wrote: 
> A child is not spoiled by giving them what they want, nearly as much as by giving substitutes for what they really want &mdash; attention, interest, and understanding. 

You alone as a parent make these decisions. May you as parent and child make many happy memories together as
members of the Native Sons and Daughters Programs&trade;.
